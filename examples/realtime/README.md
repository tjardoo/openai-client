# Real-Time Audio and Text Conversation with OpenAI GPT-4 Realtime

This example showcases how to build a real-time audio and text conversation system using OpenAI's GPT-4o Realtime API. The application processes audio and text responses from OpenAI, plays audio and displays transcripts in the console.

Users can interact with the system by sending continuous messages through the command-line interface (CLI).
